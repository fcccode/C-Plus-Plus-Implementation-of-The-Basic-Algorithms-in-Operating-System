# C++ Implementation of The Basic Algorithms in Operating System
## The project of Page-Replacement-Algorithm-Implementation implements several basic page replacement algorithms, such as OPT, FIFO and LRU.

* This project has the basic functions of OPT, FIFO and LRU. Besides, it contains  a process of randomly generating instructions to simulate the actual page replacement process.   

## The project of Multi-level-Feedback-Queue is a famous algorithm in process scheduling.

* This project is a demo of MFC programmer, which is better to simulate the dynamic scheduling of processes.  

## The project of The-Demo-of-Windows-Resource-Manager is a Windows resource manager, which has the basic function of a resource manager.

* This resource manager has the functions of Resource management tree which can click to select a folder, double click to open a file and resizing the window dynamically. The resource manager lacks the functions of main menu implementation and right-click menu implementation, which are  worth studying.
